# monster-file-converter
 python program that converts tetra-cube.com's .MONSTER files from its dnd statblock maker
 it outputs a file that has formatting that emulates the look and stats for homebrewery files.
 I did this because copy-pasting info from between the two is painfully boring, I needed to learn how to code again, and I can read tetra-cube's page better than I can hand-type the homebrewery monster stat blocks.
